                <p>My name is Asha, and I'm a Computer Science student at Rochester Institute of Technology. I’m studying computer science because I look around me and I see mind-blowing things: cars that drive themselves, computers we can have a conversation with, machines that are saving lives… and I want to be a part of that! I want to use my education to do the kind of work that leaves a meaningful impact on our society.
